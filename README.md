### Getting and cleaning data

The repo contains R script called run_analysis.R. It automatically assumes that you set your current working directory and proceeds to getting and 'mangling' the data

No function to be called - script is runs from beginning to the end producing two files as an assignment completion requires: `data-with-mean-and-std.txt` and `feature-means-by-activity.txt`

For more detailed information, see `run_analysis.R` or read the [CodeBook.md]
